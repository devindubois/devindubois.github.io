Notable projects:

[Polygo: educational computer science website](https://polygo.study)
Polygo serves as a way to learn and stay familiar with data structures and algorithms. Whether you are just starting to learn or have studied them in the past, Polygo offers a fun way to get practice in without needing to pick up a textbook. Inspired by Duolingo's gameified approach to learning a language, we hoped to replicated the experience to help developers get ready for interviews.
